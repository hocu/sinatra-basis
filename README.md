# Sinatra Basis

Sinatra Basis is a starter app for Sinatra. It was build for my personal projects and keeps evolving along with my needs, thus, consider it *heavily work in progress* 

At the moment out of the box it supports Asset Pipeline (via sinatra-asset-pipeline gem), ORM (via data_mapper gem), I18n (via I18n gem), SASS, Coffee Script.

It has a some predefined rake tasks including tests and interactive console via tux gem.

Check the Gemfile to see what else it has to offer.

## How to?

Clone or download the repo. CD into it and run `bundle install`. Run the server with `shotgun`. `enjoy`!
